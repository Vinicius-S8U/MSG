it looks a lot like the tmbd app but that's the intention, use it like some sort of standard for the rest of the app.

while I'm doing it i'll try and implement firebase Auth, storage and maybe push in notification.  

Using of course the best of practices like MVVM + clean Architecture and DI w dagger2.
